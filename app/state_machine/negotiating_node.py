Text of the ad:
{last_message}

Extract the following data from the text:
        - Deal type: "fix" or "cpm", if the blogger agrees to work with these terms, or leave empty if not.
        - Price in dollars (just a number), if the blogger provides a price for their services.
        - Solution: "rejected", if the blogger refuses to work or does not want to continue negotiations, or leave empty if the blogger is willing to continue discussions.

The answer MUST be strictly in JSON format:
{{
    "deal_type": "fix" | "cpm" | null,
    "price": number | null,
    "solution": "rejected" | null
}}

Example of a correct answer:
{{
    "deal_type": "cpm",
    "price": 300,
    "solution": null
}}
